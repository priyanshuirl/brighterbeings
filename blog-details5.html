                                        The ability to converse in a language, particularly in English while talking in
                                        the Indian context, is far from the ability to communicate.<br />
                                        While the former is mere exchange of words, the latter implies the use of social
                                        & language skills to effectively convey ideas and instructions. And that is
                                        where communication skills come in.<br />
                                        <br />
                                        Lack of communication is a big problem for any workplace. Just look at the story
                                        of how Nokia lost the battle against the emergence of smartphones, and failed to
                                        reap the benefits of riding the technological wave. All this, just because of
                                        their inability to have focused communication regarding changing market
                                        opportunities.

                                            same period. And Nokia clearly saw where the industry it dominated was
                                            heading. But its research effort was fragmented by internal rivalries and
                                            disconnected from the operations that actually brought phones to market.

                                        To succeed in today's competitive marketplace, people need more than knowledge
                                        and technical skills. The ability to communicate effectively is an essential
                                        ingredient in the development of a well rounded person with a potentially
                                        successful career.<br />
                                        1) Helps with collaboration - In any organization, when collaborative teamwork
                                        becomes an increasing requirement, the ability to communicate well is one of the
                                        most important skills that get tapped upon.<br />
                                        For e.g. When any team with members from diverse backgrounds is required to work
                                        together, the need for effective communication skills becomes paramount. This is
                                        because it gives a motivating environment to the workers to express their ideas
                                        and concerns without inhibitions, resulting in an output which is more
                                        effective.<br />
                                        2) Helps Understand the requirements of a job - Whether it be in a formal or
                                        informal setting, the ability to explain clearly what is expected from a
                                        candidate in terms of duties & responsibilities, time-frame and other
                                        expectations thus helps the job-seeker understand what needs to be done to
                                        successfully complete any task.<br />
                                        3) Improves quality of work/ life - Being able to understand and explain the
                                        work, not just to its purpose but also why it is important, helps a person
                                        making decisions & plans become more aware of their actions and take better
                                        calculated actions. Just how well can you explain a complex concept or
                                        technicalities to a colleague or client who has no idea about your industry's
                                        jargon and is lacking technical prowess?<br />
                                        4) Helps with conflict resolution - When an individual is able to understand the
                                        viewpoints of others and communicate back effectively, it becomes easier to
                                        resolve conflicts.<br />
                                        For e.g. Suppose you are having a hard time understanding the vagueness of some
                                        instructions your team leader gave you. If, in this case, proper communication
                                        channels are followed then there must be an email trail or even a meeting with
                                        the team leader to take it up and be able to resolve it. But if you handled
                                        matters the way most people do, you'd simply shrug off the ambiguity and carry
                                        on meanwhile, leading to more such conflicts in the future.<br />
                                        It seems that recruiters and employers understand the importance of
                                        communication. As data from this LinkedIn article reveals that communication
                                        skills top the list of in-demand soft skills.<br />

                                        How to leverage communication skills in front of Recruiters<br />
                                        Communication is not just about speaking and listening. Communication in the
                                        workplace, and in life in general, includes several other facets. If you can
                                        leverage those to your advantage then you can surely make a good impression in
                                        front of recruiters:
                                        1) Non-verbal communication - Before we look at how communication works, it is
                                        important to understand that non-verbal communication happens before words are
                                        spoken. This is called body language. There are several other ways to
                                        communicate without using speech or even words. These include: touching, facial
                                        expressions, hand gestures etc. <br />
                                        Eye contact, if any, and body posture are easily noticed. Swaying shoulders &
                                        arms tell the recruiter that the candidate is nervous or anxious about the
                                        situation. In this case, you could leverage your non-verbal communication skills
                                        and relax your body, maintain eye contact, and use gestures to emphasize your
                                        points.<br />
                                        2) Clarity and Conciseness - Clarity and conciseness are vital to communicating
                                        effectively. By clarity, we mean that your messages must be clear so as to not
                                        leave any room for misunderstanding. By conciseness, or cutting down your
                                        message to one or two key points, it will make it easier for others to process
                                        your information.<br />
                                        For e.g. Saying 'I don't know....I guess I'll find time to work on this project.
                                        And even though I like working on such projects, it's just that sometimes it can
                                        get...' sounds passive aggressive and hasty. Instead, you could say, 'I
                                        appreciate your offer to work on this project. I'll let you know when I can
                                        start tomorrow.' The choice of words is important.
                                        3) Tone - The tone that you choose to talk in is something that you must be
                                        aware of, as things like pitch, voice, volume, and rhythm can just as easily
                                        give a negative connotation to your speech.<br />
                                        For e.g. a high-pitched, excited tone can be seen as childish, while a sarcastic
                                        and abrupt tone can come across as rude and arrogant.
                                        4) Show Confidence - Confidence really is contagious and can help you
                                        communicate effectively with others. If you are confident, people will be more
                                        likely to listen to you. And if they are listening, they will be more likely to
                                        trust what you say.<br />

                                        For e.g. You can leverage your speaking skills to convince your interviewer that
                                        you're the perfect candidate for a job.

                                        How to work on your communication skills?<br />
                                        Communication is as much an art as it is a science. <br />
                                        Business Author Brian Tracy says, “Communication is a skill that you can learn.
                                        It’s like riding a bicycle or typing. If you’re willing to work at it, you can
                                        rapidly improve the quality of every part of your life.”<br />
                                        So that means with time and practice, communication skills can be learnt. Here’s
                                        some tips which will help your communication skills:<br />
                                        Reading - When you read, you are more likely to pay attention to how words are
                                        formulated and how to speak so that people will hear and write so that people
                                        will read. Reading is also a great way to improve your vocabulary.<br />
                                        Listening - Listening is a three-way process: (1) verbalizing what you hear, (2)
                                        listening with your ears, and (3) understanding with your mind. Listening truly
                                        helps improve communication skills because it helps you understand others better
                                        and even see things from their perspective. <br />
                                        Participating in Group Discussions - Group discussions will give you the
                                        opportunity to speak, listen, and write with others. You'll also get to practice
                                        your skills in a low-pressure environment, so that when the time comes to face
                                        recruiters or employers, you'll have more confidence.<br />
                                        Improving your Communication Styles - This can be done by watching movies ,
                                        having dinner with friends, and even picking up the habits of people in your
                                        social circle who have a unique command over how they effectively
                                        communicate.<br />
