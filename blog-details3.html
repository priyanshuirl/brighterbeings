                                    </h2>
                                    <p class="text">
                                        Let’s take a look at a hypothetical case: you are hired as an analyst at a
                                        company that is in the manufacturing sector. In this position, you will be asked
                                        to do financial analysis and evaluate the strategy of the company. Your job is
                                        quite critical, because your insights can affect the increase or decrease in
                                        profit, which in turn can affect the future of your employer.
                                        Sounds stressful, right?
                                        The stress is infinitely more on the shoulders of recruiters to make sure that
                                        the skills of candidates being hired can actually meet the demands of the task
                                        at hand.
                                        Now, recruiters need a way to see whether their hire could make potentially good
                                        decisions. And they do this through looking for certain attributes that you need
                                        to have in order to make a major decision.
                                        These attributes are what collectively make up the ability to analyze.
                                        Looking at trends, most businesses in almost every single industry are moving
                                        towards being data driven. This rise is due to the unprecedented amount of
                                        information we’ve collected. They’re looking for people who have the capability
                                        to actually analyze the data and derive meaning out of it.<br /><br />

                                        ‘Ability to analyze’ is not subject to a certain profession or a domain. It can
                                        be just as simple as you trying to come up with a solution for a puzzle, and it
                                        can be as complex as coding and conducting software testers.<br />

                                        But how do you demonstrate ‘the ability to analyze’
                                        Well, there are certain steps involved in everything you analyze. And even
                                        though the steps change with respect to the kind of problem you are trying to
                                        solve or type of data you are trying to analyze, there is an overall principle
                                        to the approach.<br />
                                        Step #1 - Understanding the Problem<br />
                                        Suppose you work for a medium sized firm which sells Electrical components to
                                        local manufacturers and store owners. Your sales have been plummeting for months
                                        in a row and your boss has tasked you with analyzing which factors contributed
                                        to the dip in sales.<br />
                                        The first step would be to understand the problem at hand. In this case, you
                                        will need to see what has been happening in your marketing strategy, how the
                                        price of components have been changing, whether there was a dip in production or
                                        business and so on. The first step is to get as much information as you can
                                        relating to the problem that’s been given and understand why it’s happened.
                                        Step #2 - Analyzing Data and Information<br />
                                        This is where you take all the information you have gathered and make a
                                        comprehensive analysis of it, based on your understanding of the problem at
                                        hand. This will help you come up with possible explanations for this downturn in
                                        sales. The context that needs to be assessed here should be as comprehensive as
                                        possible, including factors like marketing strategy and pricing policies. There
                                        are various ways in which you can do this; for instance:<br />
                                        a) Detects Patterns in data. One of the best ways to derive insights is to find
                                        patterns in the information that you have come across. At times, finding certain
                                        commonalities can be quite difficult; however, it is a great way to make a
                                        decision.<br />
                                        Look at the graph below and see whether there are suspicious patterns or
                                        trends:<br />


                                        <img src="assets/blogs/blog3img2.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />
                                        You can clearly see that employee attrition is highest in the months between
                                        January and April, and the rate decreases as the year progresses.<br />
                                        b) Asking questions about the problem and its solution. This can lead you to the
                                        root of the problem and help you answer many questions which might otherwise
                                        remain unanswered.<br />
                                        c) Creating observations based on historical trends and forecasting. Now, this
                                        is how you can compile and analyze the data that you have gathered to make a
                                        decision, rather than just going by what you know. <br />
                                        Step #3 - Communicating the results and Taking Action<br />
                                        Now that you have understood the problem and have come up with a set of
                                        insights. If you can't verbalize these insights, then all this effort would be
                                        in vain. Making sure that your analysis also includes a set of actionable steps
                                        and strategies is imperative. For example, for people who do not understand the
                                        intricacies of industrial data, simple explanations behind some insights and how
                                        to act on them would be really helpful.<br />
                                        Remember, you would need to take feedback from your boss and other stakeholders
                                        that have been impacted by the downturn. You should also make sure that everyone
                                        who has an interest in the outcome of this analysis has access to it in order to
                                        support it.<br />

                                        How do the recruiters measure the ‘ability to analyze’<br />
                                        Recruiters don't have a magic eye to see through your resume and ascertain
                                        whether you are good at analysis or not. They need to measure the ‘ability to
                                        analyze’, just like they measure skills like programming or web design.<br />
                                        Here are some ways recruiters assess a candidate's ability to analyze:<br />
                                        They set up a situation in which they can observe how you tackle problems and
                                        how you go about analyzing them. This is usually done through interview
                                        questions such as the ones below:<br />

                                        <img src="assets/blogs/blog3img3.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />

                                        They ask what is the biggest problem the candidate has faced till now, and how
                                        the candidate solved the question. Here, the interviewer is trying to assess
                                        what the candidate considers to be a big problem, how much is that candidate
                                        willing to share, and how honest they are, etc.<br />
                                        The Recruiter may need to see you in action, so they may ask you to set up a
                                        situation which comes along with some data and analyze it. Recruiters may ask
                                        you to look at random info/problems and derive solutions for/insights out of it.
                                        An example of this would be - Candidate A has good Excel skills, so he/she will
                                        be asked to use Microsoft Excel, then given random data and asked questions like
                                        "Explain this in layman's terms."<br />
                                        In most cases though, recruiters are more than happy if they could see how you
                                        gather info, address the problems, use critical thinking to assess data and make
                                        informed decisions.<br />

                                        What can I do to develop this skill? <br />
                                        'Don’t solve the puzzle, make one.'<br />
                                        Now that seems counterintuitive. doesn't it. <br />
                                        To explain what I mean, think back to how we were told to solve puzzles as a
                                        kid. We were told to learn the basics about the puzzle first, to build it
                                        ourselves piece-by-piece and see what we can gather about solving the puzzle
                                        from that. <br />
                                        Don’t solve a puzzle, make one. As we were kids, we always solved sudoku or
                                        puzzles that we got in the newspapers/magazines. However, have you ever thought
                                        of making a puzzle on your own? Think about it, think about making a sudoku from
                                        ground zero. Once you follow this process of making a puzzle, you understand
                                        every single detail, rule, and foundations to build these puzzles. This makes
                                        your ability to analyze stronger and your ability to get into the details of a
                                        problem. <br />

                                        <img src="assets/blogs/blog3img4.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />

                                        Wear your reasoning goggles, put on your thinking hats and start fiddling with
                                        your analyzing gloves by working on practical, real-world problems. The key here
                                        is putting yourself into the shoes of a business owner or manager who has been
                                        tasked with analyzing situations like these on a regular basis. Try to figure
                                        out what lies behind any trend - is it related to the economy, changing
                                        demographics, changing tastes and so on.
