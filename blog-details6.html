                                        It’s tough being a college student. But you know what’s even tougher? Being a
                                        young professional who has entered or is just about to enter the corporate world
                                        when you have underutilized your formative years in college.<br />
                                        Now, not wasting your time in college does not mean just burying yourself in
                                        books to get those sweet A's. Yes, good grades are important and you should
                                        always aim to be a model student. But there are other aspects which count
                                        towards the tally when talking about employability (which we touched upon in one
                                        of our previous blogs).<br />
                                        There are steps you can take to add value to your profile and catapult your
                                        employability to new heights.<br />
                                        1. Building a Digital Presence<br />
                                        The world runs on the Internet now. And so does your prospective employer. The
                                        key is not to meet them halfway- but way ahead. You can create your own blog and
                                        a professional website to exhibit your capabilities and strengths. You can use
                                        these different platforms to showcase your experience as well as your
                                        expertise.<br />
                                        But the best way to build a digital presence is to create a LinkedIn account. To
                                        leverage your LinkedIn profile to the fullest:
                                        Add a professional looking Display Picture and cover photo to your profile
                                        Work on your Profile summary; after all, that’s the first thing anyone will see
                                        when they visit your profile.
                                        Add in all relevant skills and experiences<br />
                                        Use a cover image which highlights something important in your professional life
                                        Here’s what LinkedIn considers to be a rave-worthy profile.<br />

                                        <img src="assets/blogs/blog6img3.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />
                                        2. Building a Professional Network<br />
                                        Yes, the same old networking advice. It's cliché. But you don't want just
                                        contacts in your phone and business cards in your wallet. Purposefully meet new
                                        people so that there is repertoire and genuine communication. It's a lot more
                                        credible, and it can pay dividends in the long run.<br />
                                        Now, that's sound theoretical advice but how do you go about building a network
                                        practically?
                                        First, understand that the purpose of networking goes beyond meeting new people.
                                        <br />
                                        Let's take a practical example - Suppose you find your favorite leader in an
                                        industry of your interest on LinkedIn and message her to say "Hi, this is
                                        [insert your name here], a college student. I love to read your blogs."<br />
                                        Use platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to build your network.
                                        Twitter & LinkedIn are the best here - you can create a personal profile in each
                                        of these and build your own digital presence from within.<br />
                                        You can also send Cold Emails for Networking and other opportunities.
                                        While there are more nuances to this, the art of sending cold emails can be
                                        summed up to a numbers game. If you send 100 people who don't know you an email
                                        saying how you would like to work for them, get mentorship, have a chat, there's
                                        a more than decent chance that at least 5 people would respond back. <br />

                                            too busy. Giving them a way out actually makes them more likely to help you.

                                        Building genuine connection from here on is a two-way process. You need to stay

                                        relationship. And all of this is done without any sense of immediate favor. It's
                                        networking for the future, where this person could help you with referrals,

                                        you want to work in is very important. So, for a Finance or BCom student you
                                        would want them to learn tools such as Salesforce, Hubspot, Tableau, SAS, SAP,
                                        Tally, etc. While a marketing student would need to focus more on learning about
                                        tools like Adobe Photoshop or Google Analytics.<br />

                                    You can get updates on these tools and skills by following companies, recruiters and
                                    industries on Twitter and Facebook. But the best way to stay up to date is by
                                    following job boards such as Naukri, Indeed, or even LinkedIn. You can leverage the
                                    information Recruiters put there to find and master tools which are hot in your
                                    coveted industry.<br />

                                    4. Getting involved with online/offline event, clubs, communities and campaigns
                                    Doing so helps you grow and showcase your leadership skills, organizational
                                    abilities, your social media savviness, business acumen and expertise.<br />
                                    Your active participation in online communities, clubs and events and campaigns
                                    helps you stand apart from the others.
                                    We would suggest you start off with events and campaigns that create awareness
                                    regarding certain global issues or socio-political catastrophes. Join TEDx events,
                                    get involved with your college's clubs or the placement cell, appear in a variety of
                                    fests, take part in competitions and other activities that include speaking on a
                                    stage or handling behind the scenes work.
                                    Memberships such as the SHRM membership for HR students or the Indian Finance
                                    Association membership for finance students will help you stay up to date with the
                                    latest in the field.<br />
                                    The most significant benefit of joining such organizations is the community of
                                    support and a network of professionals. These memberships will help you understand
                                    the industry and the tools which are being used, who are the top performers, who are
                                    hiring and what they would require from you to get hired.<br />

                                    5. Having Volunteering on your resume<br />
                                    Whatever the reason behind volunteering, be it social media brownie points or
                                    filling out a resume, it is one of those sections that helps give your CV an edge
                                    over others.<br />
                                    Employers look for volunteering experience in candidates because it shows that you
                                    have interest in an area and that you care about it enough to invest your limited
                                    time at college to do some good.<br />
                                    It also helps as the resume of a young college student might look sparse but
                                    volunteering helps fill some gaps. To really improve on your resume, you would want
                                    to go out of your way to do something remarkable - whether it is with a NGO or a
                                    social cause. If you can do something which generates a lot of hits on social media,
                                    you will be noticed by recruiters even more. <br />

                                    6. Applying for Internships<br />
                                    When employers see that you have some experience, they are more prepared to hire
                                    you. More than that, they are more willing to pay you better on your first few jobs
                                    as well. So, adding work experience to your resume is something that should be done
                                    as soon as possible.
                                    But how do you get internships? Here's a brief guide:<br />
