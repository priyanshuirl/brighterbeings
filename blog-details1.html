                                        When you try to enter into the world of business and jobs, there are often gaps
                                        that an employer wants you to fill. That is precisely why they are giving you a
                                        job. You fill in most of the gaps through education and training.<br />
                                        But as you get further into your career, you will notice that some of these gaps
                                        are left wide open. These gaps will start to accumulate as you spend more time
                                        in various roles and positions. These gaps are actually a hole, waiting to be
                                        filled with skills. But sadly these skills are not taught as part of any
                                        curriculum.<br />
                                        Essential skills could be your ticket to get that job you've always wanted at
                                        your dream company, a job that allows you to have financial freedom. They are a
                                        means to rise above the competition, earn more money in today's workforce and
                                        climb through your career faster.<br />
                                        This is true for people at every stage in life, especially freshers, as they
                                        have yet to make a mark in the business world.
                                        Suppose you are learning finance as part of your curriculum. But the thing is,
                                        millions of other students are learning the exact same thing as part of the same
                                        course. How will you make yourself stand out? The answer lies in the skills
                                        which we will discuss in this article.

                                        Skill #1 - The Ability to Organize
                                        Ever wondered why the world has become so fast-paced? This is because we have
                                        become a society based on efficiency. People do not have time to waste, focusing
                                        on how to hit deadlines.<br />
                                        One of the most essential skills for succeeding in organizing yourself and your
                                        work to achieve objectives. This includes the ability to be able to organize
                                        meetings, plan for different scenarios, and to prioritize tasks. It is the
                                        ability to get things done; but more importantly, it is a way of not letting
                                        yourself, your organization, and the people you are working for a waste time.
                                        The ability to organize carries a vast canopy of organizational skills. <br />
                                        “Employees with excellent organizational skills are also able to keep themselves
                                        calm and prepared with systematic planning and scheduling. Employers look for
                                        workers who can schedule and delegate these smaller tasks to themselves and
                                        other employees in order to stay on track with deadlines.”
                                        For example, we can look at the typical responsibilities of Executive
                                        Assistants. They have to manage executives’ calendars so that there is no
                                        confusion regarding their obligations. They have to keep track of the
                                        executives' itineraries, keep track of all the information their bosses need,
                                        and ensure that they are available during particular time slots. In summary,
                                        they have to be extremely efficient at everything they do.<br />

                                        Skill #2 - The Ability to Analyze<br />
                                        Analyzing allows you to understand what is going on in a particular situation
                                        and enables you to make decisions accordingly. This skill is one that people
                                        find hard to master, but it is an essential one. <br />
                                        According to the Future of Jobs Survey, 2020 by the World Economic Forum,
                                        analytical thinking and innovation are the top-ranked skills employers will
                                        continue to look for in the future.
                                        For example, analyzing the marketing trends from a series of reports could be
                                        the difference between growing or not. In a general sense, analyzing can be used
                                        to make better decisions.
                                        The ability to analyze is one that you can never have enough of. It enables you
                                        to go beyond the surface and get right into the heart of problems and issues.
                                        Ideas, concepts, and theories are all made better and more useful once they are
                                        put through the analysis loop. <br />
                                        It is a skill that is required in every field, from finances to engineering
                                        projects, from marketing reports to customer service complaints.<br />
                                        One specific example I always like to use is the ability to analyze customer
                                        feedback. Analyzing every customer complaint that comes to your business can
                                        help you understand what is being said about your products and services. This
                                        could enable you to address issues before they become major problems, develop
                                        better resources and even improve on existing ones.<br />

                                        Skill #3 - The Ability to Execute<br />
                                        While planning and organizing tasks are one thing, the ability to execute them
                                        is a whole other. Executing means that you need to be able to put into action
                                        what you have planned. It's the difference between making plans and following
                                        through with them.<br />
                                        This video by Wharton, University of Pennsylvania sums it up about perfectly:
                                        https://youtu.be/dqm1dF-pApo
                                        Executing involves doing things and reaching goals, which is how people make a
                                        name for themselves in a company. You need to determine how to plan for work and
                                        how to get the best out of yourself and others.<br />
                                        “Ideas are cheap. Ideas are easy. Ideas are common. Everybody has ideas. Ideas
                                        are highly, highly overvalued. Execution is all that matters.” ~ Casey Neistat
                                        For example, you might be faced with a tricky situation in your job. You need to
                                        solve problems or find different solutions to a given problem. You can either
                                        give up or see if there is another solution that no one has thought of
                                        yet.<br />
                                        One example of a job where this skill will help is a Project Manager or an
                                        Office Administration/Executive Assistant role. Like in a situation where your
                                        boss needs to have certain reports by EOD. You will have to find out how you can
                                        get said report, get a team to work on making said report a reality, and
                                        finally, solve any problems that arise from the report's completion if a
                                        deadline is due.<br />

                                        Skill #4 - The Ability to Communicate<br />
                                        It is said that just because you can talk and understand English does not mean
                                        you know how to effectively communicate. Business Communication is characterized
                                        by more than just knowledge of a language. Understanding someone else's point of
                                        view, and getting your own point across, especially in a big organization, is
                                        nothing short of a miracle. You need to be able to express yourself
                                        professionally and convincingly to gain the respect of others when they are
                                        working with you. <br />
                                        One such situation people usually face as young professionals is when they are
                                        tasked with persuading their superiors to see things from their perspective. You
                                        might have noticed that this skill is crucial in any field, from customer
                                        service to business development and management, to name just a few.<br />
                                        However, there are many ways you can learn this skill:<br />
                                        Active Listening<br />
                                        Showing Empathy<br />
                                        Practicing in different situations<br />
                                        This Stanford Graduate School of Business is sure to help you understand the
                                        concept of structure while communicating:<a
                                            href="https://youtu.be/HAnw168huqA?t=2353">
                                            https://youtu.be/HAnw168huqA?t=2353</a><br />

                                        While you do not have to learn a whole range of skills, a jack of all trades is
                                        better than a master of one. These skills aren't a replacement for hard skills
                                        and proper knowledge, but they will help you stay ahead of your colleagues and
                                        prove your worth to employers.
                                        The chances of distinguishing yourself as a young professional are slim, and a
                                        lot of it boils down to inexperience and beginners' struggle. However, suppose
                                        you could incorporate these skills into yourself and demonstrate that you are
                                        adept at them. In that case, you could easily win over many employers.<br />
