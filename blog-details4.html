                                    <p class="text">
                                        Execution is being able to take on the different tasks that are necessary in
                                        order for a great idea to become a successful product, business or service.
                                        Without execution, it doesn't matter how good an idea is — it won't make money.
                                        It doesn't matter whether people like your product or not — again, you won't
                                        make money from it. Execution provides results—or profits—from a good
                                        idea.<br />
                                        As a young graduate, your first job is to sell yourself and your skills. So, it
                                        is important that you can convince the recruiter/employer that you have the
                                        ability to carry out key responsibilities of the job. You need to be able to
                                        demonstrate that you are going to be able to execute the tasks which are listed
                                        in the job posting. A great deal of emphasis is put on the ability of an
                                        individual in terms of how he or she can perform the job during an interview.

                                        What is the ability to execute?<br>
                                        A person's ability to effectively implement ideas and carry out a particular
                                        task. The ability to creatively and effectively implement ideas to reach desired
                                        outcomes that results in profit or a quality product/service.
                                        It also involves business skills such as getting things done, setting goals,
                                        working within time constraints, and being able to manage projects properly. It
                                        also involves having passion for what you do and being perseverant against all
                                        odds in order to achieve success even though you have limited resources
                                        available with which to work with.<br /><br />

                                        Understanding The Ability to Execute from a recruiters perspective<br />
                                        Gartner's Magic Quadrant is a powerful concept where the ability to execute is
                                        explained quite effectively in terms of setting a vision and having the ability
                                        to execute that vision. It is important that you are able to communicate to the
                                        interviewer, or recruiter, how you will be able to develop and work on an almost
                                        infinite number of possible ways of carrying out a task.
                                        It is important that your creativity, intelligence and communication skills are
                                        demonstrated in an interview so that the interviewer can be convinced that you
                                        have all the qualities necessary for accomplishing tasks. You need to impress
                                        your interviewer not just with your technical skills, but with everything else
                                        as well.<br /><br />

                                        Gartner's Magic Quadrant has been widely used by recruiters and employers today
                                        as a tool in order to employ people who they believe have good ideas but are
                                        also able to carry out those ideas well.<br />
                                        As an employee with such skill, you are quite valuable to any company with
                                        high-level quality and performance goals for the products and services it
                                        offers.<br />
                                        Consider that to be a good employee, it is important that you can manage your
                                        time effectively, set reasonable goals and follow through with the tasks
                                        associated with achieving those goals.<br />

                                    How to improve your ‘ability to execute’<br />
                                    When recruiters are looking for a person to fill a job, they look for specific
                                    skills in order to find out if someone has what it takes to work in that position. A
                                    passion for what you do is considered as an important skill, because the best
                                    employers know that having passion and drive will lead to higher productivity and
                                    better quality of work.<br />
                                    So how can you improve your ability to execute:<br />
                                    1) The first thing you can do is to be clear about your plans & goals. Without a
                                    sight in mind, even the most experienced captains fail to steer the ship, just as
                                    new captains find themselves caught up in being able to ‘go with the flow’. <br />
                                    2) You need to know when it is time to move from a dead-end task and make a change.
                                    The most successful people accept the challenge of making an unusual
                                    decision....taking the risk of leaving behind their comfort zone.<br />
                                    3) In order to improve your ability to execute, you must be open-minded and
                                    receptive. There are no limits to the possibilities, and if you allow yourself to
                                    see them, your mind will volunteer itself to the task of thinking about a variety of
                                    solutions.<br />
                                    4) The ability to execute is not just about being proactive, but also being able to
                                    be reactive...to act on assignments/suggestions/initiatives given by others. So try
                                    to understand what is told, and ask questions when in doubt.<br />
                                    5) You must understand that, when it comes down to executing tasks, there are all
                                    kinds of people who are good at doing certain things (and not good at doing others).
                                    Focus on what you are good at, and delegate what you think others could do better
                                    for you.<br />

                                    Closing Thoughts<br />
                                    If you execute everything you've learned in this article, then your 'execution
                                    capabilities' ala 'the ability to execute' will go through the roof. Rather than
                                    seeing an opportunity as a risk, you will find ways to make it work in your
                                    favor.<br />

                                                this best become market leaders. Google, for example, was not the first

                                                but according to Investopedia, Google was the first to really monetize
