                                        Prof BB - Good Morning, Sinjini! How are you?<br />
                                        Sinjini - Good Morning, Ma'am! I'm Good!<br />
                                        Prof BB - So what brings you to my office this early? Usually, you kids cannot
                                        wait to get out of my sight when my lecture is over.<br />
                                        Sinjini - Ma'am, I was a little concerned about my career. I just read somewhere
                                        that Business Graduates like myself cannot get good jobs. Is that true?<br />
                                        Prof BB - Well, speaking about any graduate, it's true that they have a hard
                                        time finding a job. But if you work hard to be good at what you're doing, I'm
                                        sure you will not have to worry about a job. But if you want the truth, then
                                        yes, employers do hesitate before hiring business graduates.

                                        Sinjini - And why is that?
                                        Prof BB – I'll try to answer that if you want to know. But before that, do you
                                        know what employability is?<br />
                                        Sinjini - Employability? Um, isn't that my ability, well, anyone's ability to
                                        get employed & then remain employed.<br />
                                        Prof BB - Precisely. Very Good Sinjini. But there's a mistake you're making
                                        here. You are thinking of employability from a young fresher's perspective.
                                        Think about it from an employer's perspective.<br />
                                        Sinjini - Like what do employers look for in a Business Graduate?<br />
                                        Prof BB - Yes.<br />
                                        Sinjini - Good Grades…?<br />
                                        Prof BB - Well, yes. But from an employer's perspective, employability is more
                                        of a set of qualities they are looking for when hiring a business
                                        graduate.<br />
                                        “In the new world of work security lies not in employment, but in
                                        employability.”
                                        Sinjini - Oh!<br />
                                        Prof BB – To answer your question, employers don't hire business graduates for
                                        good job roles because they lack basic employability skills.<br />
                                        Sinjini – Basic employability qualities, Hmm. What are these?<br />
                                        Prof BB - Basic employability skills are critical in getting a job. They include
                                        creativity, ability to communicate effectively, problem-solving, etc. But
                                        because these skills are not the focus of college education, fresh graduates
                                        often lack these skills.<br />

                                    Sinjini - Okay, I think I understand.<br />
                                    Prof BB - Good! Now, suppose we want to talk about the current scenario of the
                                    job market. In that case, the thing is that there is no dearth of jobs which
                                    involve roles in various fields such as Customer Success, Inside Sales, Digital
                                    Marketing, Data Analysis, Office Administration, or even Sales.<br />
                                    Sinjini -Why aren't companies hiring business graduates for these roles?<br />
                                    Prof BB - What graduates lack is the ability to work on the practical part of
                                    it. The problem with our business graduates is that they lack the technical
                                    skills which are very important in this era. This is also one of the reasons why
                                    employers hesitate to hire from this stream. And business graduates have the
                                    theoretical knowledge which is required for these jobs. They don't know how to
                                    analyze complex problems or operate specialized tools. In fact, some can't even
                                    understand the problem. Very few can use their existing skill sets for routine
                                    tasks like interpreting trends in data or using calendars. For example, suppose
                                    there is data given to you, and you need to draw some insights from it. In that
                                    case, you should be able to use MS Excel and other tools to analyze the data and
                                    come up with those insights. Or, if you are an executive assistant, you should
                                    be good at organizing schedules or making travel arrangements.<br />
                                    Sinjini - And what about the tools required in these jobs?<br />
                                    Prof BB – Let me tell you about that. If a business graduate has studied how to
                                    manage a business or how to use basic software such as Excel or PowerPoint and
                                    other aspects of business administration, then shouldn't he or she be expected
                                    to show the slightest bit of proficiency in learning new tools. There's
                                    Salesforce, Zoho, Hubspot, PivotTables, or Power BI? How do you use them?
                                    In fact, this is one of the many reasons why employability skills are so
                                    important. There is a tremendous number of new tools and software available
                                    these days. Many of these solutions can be used to analyze and visualize data in
                                    ways that haven't been possible before.<br />
                                    <img src="assets/blogs/blog0img1.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />
                                    Sinjini - So, do soft skills matter in between all of this?<br />
                                    Prof BB - Yes, soft skills do matter. Soft skills are all about interpersonal
                                    skills. They include communication, empathy, leadership & other aspects of
                                    interpersonal relationships. Critical thinking ability is also limited among
                                    business graduates because of the not-so-rigorous nature of the degree. But our
                                    business graduates have not thought beyond their existing skill sets.<br />
                                    Sinjini - How can students overcome this?<br />
                                    Prof BB - Students should look to complement their college education with
                                    practical learning. There are some great resources out there. They should look
                                    for hands-on learning where they are required to use their existing skills and
                                    are also taught other skills to increase their employability prospects. They
                                    should look for opportunities where they could work on practical projects. For
                                    example, they should learn how to manipulate or draw insights from that data and
                                    help simplify it to present the data trends to a non-technical audience. Or to
                                    use statistical methods to generate useful business insights. According to
                                    research by Boston University, experiential learning through internships,
                                    community service, and hands-on projects could significantly benefit
                                    students.<br />
                                    <img src="assets/blogs/blog0img3.png" style="width: 100%; margin:24px 0px;" />
                                    Sinjini - Thank you ma'am. So, students should look for avenues where they could
                                    learn skills that are in-demand but practical. <br />
                                    Prof BB - Yes. And it is not just about the tools. It is also about the
                                    analytical skills required to use those tools. Students should also look for
                                    ways to solve problems with these tools, which not many have been taught in
                                    college. They should work on coming up with solutions and learn how to be
                                    innovative & creative while solving the problem. Now, you must go. I don't want
                                    to drag this on for long.<br />
                                    Sinjini - Oh, am I taking up too much of your time?<br />
                                    Prof BB - Not really! But you will miss your Finance Lecture if you continue
                                    talking to me.<br />
