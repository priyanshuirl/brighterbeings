                                    </h2>
                                    <p class="text">
                                        In our previous article, we focused on how students pursuing business degrees
                                        can make themselves more employable by focusing on building a well-rounded
                                        profile. <br />
                                        But, to reiterate, the subjects you study and your expertise in them is the
                                        primary factor that recruiters focus on. That is why, vast knowledge of your
                                        chosen field can make you stand out from others and can help you establish a
                                        better position, negotiate for better perks, and also gain more respect in the
                                        eyes of your employer. <br />
                                        It is not just about the acquisition of knowledge about your subject but also
                                        about learning how to apply that knowledge to actual situations which makes the
                                        difference.<br />
                                        So, in this article, we will list the 5 most important subjects a BCom graduate
                                        should focus on, and how to apply what you learn with those subjects in the
                                        corporate world.<br />

                                        1. The Fundamentals of Financial Management<br />
                                        Financial Management is one of the most important subjects to be studied by a
                                        BCom student. It not only helps the students understand the basic elements of
                                        finance, but also helps them understand the perspective with which financial
                                        statements, balance sheets, income statements etc., are applied in the business
                                        world.<br />
                                        Now, the application of Financial Management is more focused on the financing
                                        decisions a business has to take. The reason for this is simple – in the real
                                        world, a business needs to make money by bringing in cash and using that money
                                        to grow their business. And, this does not happen overnight.
                                        For example – Firms make financing decisions by using the information in their
                                        balance sheet, journals, cash flow statements, etc.<br />
                                        The key is understanding how the information in your balance sheet translates
                                        into financing decisions. This is where Financial Management helps you acquire
                                        this knowledge.<br />
                                        Financial Management takes many forms – understanding the difference between
                                        cash and non-cash transactions, how a balance sheet works, and understanding how
                                        a company goes about borrowing money to finance its businesses are some of them.
                                        Using ratios such as the Debt to Equity ratio, the Interest Coverage ratio etc.
                                        to evaluate a firm's debt management capabilities is also something a BCom
                                        student should be aware of. It also covers the use of basic concepts such as
                                        amortization to pay off debt, or the use of depreciation to periodically lower
                                        the value and thus tax liability of assets. This conveys how strong your
                                        fundamentals are.<br />
                                        If you are in need of supplementary learning, IIT Roorkee's Financial Management
                                        Series by Prof. Anil K. Sharma is the way to go.<br />

                                        2. Corporate Accounting<br />
                                        The next important subject in BCom is Corporate Accounting. This subject gives
                                        students a complete understanding of the regulatory environment in which
                                        companies are formed. But for that, a solid foundation in basic accounting and
                                        financial concepts is required.<br />
                                        For example, let's say you have to decide on how you want to divide company
                                        profits in the form of dividends, stock appreciation, salary and bonuses. If you
                                        don't know how to deal with the issues of taxation, etc., this will be a big
                                        issue for you.<br />
                                        Other than that, you will also get a good idea about the company's operations.
                                        This gives you a better view on their financial statement and what the metrics
                                        like revenue and profit would be over time.<br />
                                        Another important aspect of Corporate Accounting would be interpreting and
                                        analyzing financial statements, accounting principles, and techniques for making
                                        decisions in business settings.
                                        This should give you a complete overview about accounting results of different
                                        companies so that you can analyze these results in order to differentiate
                                        between these firms – understanding differences among revenues from different
                                        divisions of companies is one such example where understanding Corporate
                                        Accounting can help.<br />

                                        3. Business Research and Statistics<br />
                                        Research, especially Quantitative methods and Statistical Analysis used to
                                        ascertain the market for viability of new products, or competition to existing
                                        ones, is a crucial part of commerce.
                                        Any role in a business requires knowledge on research and analysis and students
                                        should be able to make use of this in their work.<br />
                                        Business Research and Statistics, on a most fundamental level, involves
                                        investigating and studying a particular business process to enable you to
                                        understand how it functions, how it can be improved upon, or alternatively if
                                        there is an opportunity for a new business venture.<br />
                                        While research helps collect, explore, and present data and information,
                                        statistics is often a subset of research used to perform analysis with concepts
                                        such as normal distribution, variability, and correlation.<br />
                                        Focus on the following research and statistical methods:<br />
                                        - Data Collection & Analysis<br />
                                        - Descriptive Statistics<br />
                                        - Quantitative Methods (from Mean to Variation)<br />
                                        - Discriminant Analysis & Regression<br />
                                        - Regression Analysis & Linear Regression <br />

                                        This Subject is a backbone of the more advanced subjects such as Business
                                        Accounting, Financial Management, etc. which make use of fundamental concepts
                                        taught as part of this subject.<br />

                                        cash flow. It also helps with financial evaluations as concepts such as time
                                        value of money, and the use of discounting exist in the subject. But most
                                        importantly, business mathematics helps practically with the more advanced
                                        subject areas.<br />
                                        The following topics can be used as guide towards learning Business Math:<br />
                                        - Introduction to Financial Instruments <br />
                                        - Computing and Simple Interest calculations<br />
                                        - Time value of money (Discounting) <br />
                                        - Present Value & Series Financing <br />
                                        - The Elements of Financial Statements (EBIT, Margin) & Calculating Cash Flows
                                        <br />
                                        - Easing or Compounding & Annuities & Computing Financial Statements.
                                        (Accounting, Finance)<br />
                                        - Use of Spreadsheets (for financial analysis) in BCom. A basic understanding is
                                        required with Excel and word processing programs like MS office and Open Office
                                        is a plus point.<br />
                                        How much of a profit can be earned, or how much has to be paid to service your
                                        debits and credits cost vs operational value, how to calculate depreciation, and
                                        many other important topics are helped with Business mathematics. In the
                                        corporate world, for example, various financial and accounting calculations are
                                        performed often to meet the business requirements.<br />
                                        Grooming Education Academy has a great playlist on Business Mathematics which
                                        covers all BCom topics in great detail.<br />

                                        5. Computer Applications in Business<br />
                                        In the post-digital age, computers have become ubiquitous and their use in
                                        business has increased considerably. Students should be well versed with the
                                        basics of Computer Applications as it is not only the IT or software industry
                                        that requires them, but every industry requires computer knowledge to some
                                        extent.<br />
                                        Even in the world of commerce, the use of Computers is necessary. You should
                                        start with the basics, such as how to use an excel sheet and then move onto
                                        concepts like accounting software, and using them in actual business
                                        practices.<br />
                                        It is important you are able to use computer programs such as Microsoft Excel,
                                        Tally, PowerPoint, etc. as they will be indispensable in your professional
                                        career henceforth. Software programs assist in all phases of accounting:
                                        preparing budgets, creating reports, identifying patterns, highlighting trends,
                                        and making forecasts. This includes software such as SAP, Sage, Tally and
                                        Microsoft Dynamics. <br />
                                        For e.g., People who work in corporate accounting would tell you that they
                                        automate financial accounts with the help of enterprise software to help them
                                        with audits.<br />

                                        It is only by learning these things that you will be able to excel in the
                                        professional world as a BCom graduate. You should not get too immersed in only
                                        these subjects, you should understand the basics of all the subjects, and be
                                        capable of making quick calculations and judgments when needed.
                                        You must also understand that you'll be expected to have a firm working
                                        knowledge of your subject by the time you get employed as a graduate. If you are
                                        still learning these skills after graduation, there is no guarantee that
                                        employers will hire you.<br />
